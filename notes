<!-- NOTES -->

    * paragrafnjbgfnmd <span class=highilight> hvcjxm </span> bvchnxm hfcjxm gfdhsn
    (if you want only like a word to have dif settings in css you put SPAN and a class)

    * ul>li>a*5 (the number you want it to multiply by) -- press TAB
    (does the whole thing for you/ installed smth called EMMET)

    * button.cta{text to see on screen} --TAB
    (works for you)

OBS: if you style things in figma or smth (this dude has sketch on apple) you have dimensions and all planned aready and just write the code for it 
	
	* <br/> = enter / new line
	     or just put dif <p> s if thay can work

	*(fascinating work act) 
	SO, to do more <li> without writing all
	 write your stuff like a list, seect all, go to SELECTION - split into lines - CTRL left (sagetuta) write - CTRL right (sagetuta) write again

	 * <li>&nbsp;</li> = space that shouldnt be collapsed

	 *POPUP (i mightve skipped that class) - imagine im doing this for the subscribe or sign in smth

	 <div class="poppup">
		<div class="blanket"></div>
		<div class="content">
			<h1> fill in your details 
			<form action=>
				<div class=item>
					<label>name</label>
					<input type=text placeholder=name value=mac>
				</div>
				<div class=item>
					<label> last name</label>
					<input type=text placeholder=name>
				</div>
				<div class=item>
					<label>fav col </label>
					<input type=text placeholder=black is not a color, but same>
				</div>
				<div class=item>
					<label>age</label>
					<input type=text placeholder=18? kidding>
				</div>
			</form>
			<button class="close"></button>
		</div>
	</div>

	* apparently you cant put a JUMP TO ANOTHER PART OF THIS PAGE with the id of that on a BUTTON, you have to make it a link (a href)
